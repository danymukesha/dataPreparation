## Data Processing Phase 2 Report

This report focuses on the data processing steps involved in phase 2. It
encompasses filtering the data, transforming it using Compositional
Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation, assessing batch effects, and applying
batch correction methods such as removeBatchEffect, ComBat, PLSDA-batch,
sPLSDA-batch, and percentile normalization.
